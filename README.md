# Mouse Kidney Atlas and Extended Mouse Kidney Atlas

![workflow](Figure1-workflow.png)

We present the Mouse Kidney Atlas (MKA), a comprehensive atlas of cellular heterogeneity in the healthy mouse kidney, which we generated by carefully integrating data from eight publicly available studies. We integrate these datasets using [scVI and scANVI](https://scvi-tools.org/). To overcome annotation inconsistencies we learn the relationship between cell type transcriptomic profiles across datasets using [scHPL](https://github.com/lcmmichielsen/scHPL). This model is then able to automatically label unseen cell populations with unprecedented resolution and accuracy. We demonstrate the significance of our atlas by obtaining robust and novel markers for poorly described cell types.

The MKA is publicly available to download, visualize and interact with at [cellxgene](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/92fde064-2fb4-41f8-b85c-c6904000b859)

## Data availability

Two annotated `AnnData` objects are available in the [`data/`](data) folder of this repository:

| File | Description | Reference |
|------|--------------|------------|
| **`data/mka.h5ad`** | Baseline Mouse Kidney Atlas used in [Novella-Rausell *et al.*, *iScience*, 2023](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(23)00954-9). Contains 141,401 cell/nuclei × 3,000 genes integrated across eight studies. | *iScience*, 2023 |
| **`data/mka_extended_cleaned.h5ad`** | Extended version used in [Yasinoglu *et al.*, *JASN*, 2025](https://journals.lww.com/jasn/abstract/9900/spatial_transcriptomics_reveals_injured_cells,.803.aspx). Contains 303,791 cells/nuclei × 12,156 genes. Enriched with immune, injury-induced, and PKD-specific populations, used for Tangram-based deconvolution of spatial data. Cleaned version with redundant QC and modality columns removed. | *JASN*, 2025 |

Both datasets are also archived on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10159136) for citation and long-term preservation.

## File descriptions
- **data/** — Contains the main `AnnData` reference atlases:  
  - `mka.h5ad` (baseline atlas)  
  - `mka_extended_cleaned.h5ad` (extended atlas for PKD study)
- **models**: Files containing the trained models used in both manuscripts
- **notebooks**: notebooks used to generate the figures presented in [Novella-Rausell *et al.*, *iScience*, 2023]
     - <u>QC_scVI_scANVI </u>: Figure 1
     - <u>scHPL_ManualReannotation </u>: Figure 2 and 3

        Supplementary Figures 1, 2 and 3
     - <u>scHPL_Evaluation </u>: Figure 4

        Supplementary Figure 4 and 5
     - <u>Downstream_analyses </u>: Figure 5

        Supplementary Figure 6
- **MKA_Metamarkers.xlsx** Excel file with the identified metamarkers for each cell type label in the MKA ([Novella-Rausell *et al.*, *iScience*, 2023]).
    - **Rank**: Overall ranking for this gene within a cell type. The higher the ranking the better the marker is for the given population accounting for batch differences and number of datasets in which the gene is detected. 
    - **AUROC**: Area under the receiver-operator curve. This value is an indication of how good the gene is in a classification scenario. For example, Podxl has an AUROC value of 0.9, which means that this gene is very good at classifying Podocytes as such.

- **functions.py** helper functions used across the code
- **hyper_tune.py** [Ray tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html) implementation to optimize scVI model hyperparameters

## Using the trained models

To use the trained models or load the atlases for your own analyses:

``` python
import os
import scvi
import scanpy as sc

# Change directory to the repo root
os.chdir("MKA")

# Load the baseline atlas
adata = sc.read_h5ad("data/mka.h5ad")

# Load model trained on this atlas
atlas_model = scvi.model.SCANVI.load("models/scANVI_model_full", adata=adata)

# Or, to load the extended version
adata_ext = sc.read_h5ad("data/mka_extended_cleaned.h5ad")
```

## Hyperparameter Optimization

[Ray tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html) was used train 1000 different hyperparameter and model configurations. 

The tracked metrics at each training epoch were ``'elbo_validation'``, '``reconstruction_loss'`` and ``'silhouette_score'``. Batch and cell type silhouette scores computed on the latent space were used as objective functions to maximize during training. 

The search space was defined as follows:

- model configuration
    - dropout rate: loguniform distribution between `1e-4` and `1e-1`
    - number of layers: random integer between `1` and `3`
    - number of latent dimensions: random integer between `20` and `31`
- plan configuration
    - learning rate: loguniform distribution between `1e-4` and `1e-1`
- atlas architecture
    - subset: random boolean (`True`/ `False`). 
    > The purpose of this parameter is to test the effect of filtering the feature space
    - number of hvgs: random choice between ``2000`` and ``8000`` in ``1000`` increments
    - continious_covariates: random choice between ``'pct_counts_mt'`` and ``None``
    - categorical_covariates: random choice between ``'Source'`` and ``None``
    > 'Source' in this case refers to either nuclei or cell as the starting material
- number of epochs: random number between ``100`` and ``201``
